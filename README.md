# Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website.

Structure

- `index.html` — main landing page
- `src/css/` — styles
- `src/js/` — client-side scripts
- `assets/` — images, fonts
- `projects/` — each project in its own folder

How to view locally

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or run a local static server, for example:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

or with npm:

```powershell
npm install -g live-server; live-server
```

Next steps: add individual project pages inside `projects/` and replace placeholder assets.

Resume

- PDF: `docs/Harinder_Singh_SharePoint_Developer_Resume.pdf`

Notes

- This site has been updated to reflect Harinder Singh's resume (skills, experience, projects). Open `index.html` in a browser or run the local static server to preview.
